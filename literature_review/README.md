| 2 | `CDC42` | This gene encodes a member of the Rho subfamily
of small GTP-binding proteins and plays a key role
in cancer cell migration and metastasis. [Consor-
tium, 2020, Al Haddad et al., 2020] found decreased
levels of StarD13, a surpressor of CDC42, in lung
tumor tissue and A549 cells subsequently leading
to increased CDC42 activation thus increasing for-
mation of invadopodia, a unique hallmark of cancer,
and matrix degradation. |

| 3 | `PTPRC` | This gene encodes a tyrosine-protein phosphatase re-
quired for T-cell activation. Upon T-cell activation,
PTPRC recruits and dephosphorylates FYN which
has been shown to be correlated with LUAD by [Con-
sortium, 2020]. [Wei et al., 2021] directly supports
PTPRC association with LUAD by demonstrating
that PTPRC was a key gene in affecting the immune
state of the tumor microenvironment and was ulti-
mately correlated with a variety of tumor-infiltrating
immune cells. |

| 4 | `LRRK2` | In an analysis of TCGA LUAD RNA-seq data,
[Lebovitz et al., 2021] identified that decreased
LRRK2 expression is associated with LUAD. In
[Lebovitz et al., 2015], reduced LRRK2 expression
was found to promote LUAD tumorigenesis and was
associated with poor survival outcomes. This study
also found overactivity in LRRK2 contributes to
Parkinsonâ€™s disease, which suggests pathological links
between neurodegenerative disease and cancer are
emerging. |

| 5 | `CREB1` | This gene encodes a phosphorylation-dependent tran-
scription factor that stimulates transcription upon
binding to DNA cAMP response element (CRE)
[Consortium, 2020]. [Wang et al., 2021a] used pro-
tein expression assays to understand the underlying
mechanism of ferroptosis, a new form of regulated
cell death associated with cancer, in LUAD. They
found that CREB was highly expressed in LUAD
and knockdown of CREB inhibited cell viability and
growth by promoting apoptosis- and ferroptosis-like
cell death. |

| 8 | `ISG15` | ISG15 acts as a cytokine, modulating immune re-
sponses, and can delay tumor cell growth by inhibit-
ing tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis. [Qu
et al., 2020] found that high expression of ISG15
serves as a positive prognostic marker for long-term
survival in LUAD patients. ISG15 has a broad net-
work of protein targets, and [Yoo et al., 2018] con-
cludes that covalent ISG15 conjugation enhances
the tumor-suppressive activity of the carboxyl ter-
minus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP), thereby
showing an antitumor effect of Type 1 interferon. |

| 9 | `FYN` | FYN encodes a tyrosine-protein kinase essential in
cell motility and adhension and plays an important
role in the PI3K/AKT pathway responsible for regu-
lating the cell cycle [Consortium, 2020]. [Xue et al.,
2020] demonstrated that overexpression of FYN ac-
celerated cell apoptosis and reduced both angiogensis
capacity and PI3K/AKT expression levels in lung
carcinoma A549 cells. Conversely, FYN expression
was shown to be correlated with LUAD prognosis
as FYN expression levels were shown to be down-
regulated in LUAD tissues and cells. |

| 10 | `ITGB1` | ITGB1 encodes the Integrin beta-1 subunit which
when associated with Integrin alpha-3 provides a
docking site for FAP, a serine protease involved in
extracellular matrix degradation and tumor growth,
at invadopodia plasma membranes. Hence ITGB1
may participate in formation of invadopodia, matrix
degradation, and can promote cell invasion [Consor-
tium, 2020]. Immune infiltration analysis revealed
that the ITGB1-DT/ARNTL2 axis may effect the
progression of LUAD and the immune microenviron-
ment [Qiu et al., 2021]. |

| 4800* | `FTL` | A study published in 2021 demonstrated a negative
correlation between high expression of FTL or LUAD
malignancy and a decrease in lipid peroxidation and
labile.[Wang et al., 2021b] In an RNA-sequencing
study, FTL and FTH1 expression levels were signifi-
cantly positively correlated with tumor infiltration
by tumor-associated macrophages and T regulatory
cells. [Lucchetta et al., 2019] Ferritin light chain
(FTL) and ferritin heavy chain (FTH1) were com-
pared and FTL subunits had higher expression levels
for LUAD than its heavy chain iron counterpart.
FTL also had higher expression for tumorous tissues
in most types of cancer, and LUAD showed higher
levels of expression and tumor tissue (in comparison
to other subtypes of cancer) for the FTL experiment
[Lucchetta et al., 2019]. |

| 12626* | `TFF3` | It is involved in the maintenance and repair of the
intestinal mucosa. It also promotes the mobility of
epithelial cells during healing [Consortium, 2020]
The highest classified gene from the MLP node-only
model is TFF3. This gene was excluded from the
training set because it had a GDA score of 0.01,
but an association has already been detected by Dis-
GeNet. In 2021, for the first time it was shown that
TFF3 was associated with sub diseases of LUAD and
was specifically associated with LUAD invasiveness
[Luo et al., 2020]. In 2019, TFF3 was identified as a
biomarker to be able to distinguish between LUAD
and lung squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) [Wang
et al., 2015]. In [Wang et al., 2015], over 90% of
LUAD was observed to be TFF3 positive, whereas
no TFF3 expression was observed in cases of SCC,
suggesting TFF3 is an insightful biomarker that en-
ables experts to distinguish and diagnose subtypes
of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). |
