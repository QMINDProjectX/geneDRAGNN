## Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)

### "GCNs draw on the idea of Convolution Neural Networks re-defining them for the non-euclidean data domain. They are convolutional, because filter parameters are typically shared over all locations in the graph unlike typical GNNs." [1]().

## Graph SAGE(SAmple and aggreGatE)

### Previous approaches are transductive and don't naturally generalize to unseen nodes. GraphSAGE is an inductive framework leveraging node feature information to efficiently generate node embeddings.

### "ChebNet is a formulation of CNNs in the context of spectral graph theory. []().

### "GAT is able to attend over their neighborhoodsâ€™ features, implicitly specifying different weights to different nodes in a neighborhood, without requiring any kind of costly matrix operation or depending on knowing the graph structure upfront."
